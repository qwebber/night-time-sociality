This repository contains the code to produce caribou social networks as well as caribou and predator movement rates to test the risky times and risky places hypotheses.
Scripts are under `code/`, data used to run models and generate figures is available under `output/`, and raw data are available upon request.

The manuscript is in revision at Canadian Journal of Zoology.


## Abstract

Risk could vary temporally with predator activity levels or as animals age. While risk could vary spatially as a function of habitat complexity, where open habitats are risky because prey are more visible to predators. Prey, such as caribou (Rangifer tarandus), attenuate predator risk by altering behaviour through space and time. We tested the “risky times” and “risky places” hypotheses to investigate how sociality can mitigate putative risk during risky times and in risky places. We predicted that caribou are social in risky times (e.g., night and calving) because their predators are primarily nocturnal and newborn calves are vulnerable. We also predicted that sociality is higher in open habitats at nighttime relative to closed habitats at nighttime to mitigate risk during a riskier time and place. We used location data collected from GPS collared caribou in Newfoundland to generate social networks to estimate sociality. In winter, caribou were more social at night than during the day. During the night, caribou were more social in open habitat than in forested habitat, indicating a potential trade-off between selecting open foraging habitat and the risk of predation. We illustrate that sociality mitigates risky times and risky places.
